# Margo Prototype

**Margo** is a hybrid streaming and social media platform where lyrics become the language of communication.  
It connects music streaming, artist promotion, and social interaction — allowing users to share and reply using song lyrics directly linked to licensed tracks.

## Vision
Margo redefines how people connect and express themselves through music.  
The platform merges the best of social media and streaming services, empowering artists, creators, and fans to interact in meaningful, music-driven ways.

## Why Margo
- Brings a new form of communication centered on music and lyrics.  
- Supports artists through direct royalties and song-based engagement.  
- Bridges social interaction, discovery, and monetization in one platform.  

## Developed In
Geneva, Switzerland — inspired by Switzerland’s culture of innovation and neutrality, and built with a vision to show that the next generation of global social platforms can be created here.
